> ### 2014 ADVERSE REACTION

{{< figure width=100% align=center src="images/AR-1.jpg"  >}}

In March 2014, I had independently produced 'Adverse Reaction'for the Old Operat- ing Theatre Museum of the medical group in London for three months. In November of the same year, 'CUT'exhibition was successfully held for the Museum of the Old Operating Theatre in London, UK.In December of the same year, the exhibition 'women's power'was held at Central St Martins, University of the Arts, London.

The story takes place in the Victorian era, a patient took a drug with side effects that had not been well studied, and had hallucinations and finally died. The progress of drug research in Victorian period brought many uncontrollable adverse reactions to patients.Many medical accidents happened.

Under the condition of reaching a consensus with the old operating Theatre Museum, I has made a new attempt in the animation concept design.All the picture creation is improvised.In the animation, you can see the combination of a variety of painting styles. The process of creation relies on intuition to convey the illusion in the story, it is embodied in the bold and unrestrained picture, and the cohesion of colors has also made a great leap forward.
