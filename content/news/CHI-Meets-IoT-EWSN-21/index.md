My Workshop paper on CHIIoT 2021 is Now Available at CEUR! 

### Workshop Brief
> The CHIIoT workshop series bring together researchers and practitioners from HCI design, computer science, and electrical engineering working on new challenges in industry and academia. The workshop will provide a platform for participants to review and discuss challenges and opportunities in the intersection of computer-human interaction and the internet of things, focusing on human-centered applications using emerging connectivity and sensing technologies. We aim to jointly develop a design space and identify opportunities for future research. The first workshop (CHIIoT 1) will be co-located with EWSN 2021: The 18th International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks.

### Achievability
CHIIoT'21 published its own proceedings with CEUR-WS, so that the position papers could be indexed in Scopus, Google Scholar, and likely DBLP Ref. Also, the references will count into the citation statistics of these platforms, gaining the research visibility to the researchers cited by the position papers. Papers published from this workshop are made open sourced by the CEUR-WS.org under the Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).
